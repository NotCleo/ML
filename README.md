        I started to pick up on streamlit, mainly because I've been wanting to put a face to all the crazy models I've been trying to build over the past few months.
        I started off on their cool documentation page - https://streamlit.io/. Really saves time honestly, as I'd call it, 'Poor man's" WEBDEV lol.
        
        Anyways, My first trial ML project on streamlit was on the popular Iris Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris. 
        BTW, it's streamlit run nameofyourfile.py and yes it's pip3 install streamlit (dw its all in the requirements.txt)

        GUESS WHAT! I have no idea how random forest classifier works as of now, but don't you worry, I got it covered, It's a trial run to see if I'm able to deploy a good interactive frontend in minimal time, My actual work lies in the other python scripts/models I've been writing painstakingly slow. Check the file names starting with a number in front :).
